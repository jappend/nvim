### What is this repo?
My config from NeoVim, just clone this repo's content to `~/.config/nvim` or wherever your nvim folder is located.

#### Requirements:
Depending on the language, you may need to download some LSP's.

---
Download (RipGrep)[https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep] to make the LiveGrep work and (fd)[https://github.com/sharkdp/fd] for some extended capabilities.

Just download xclip, or any other clipboard provider.
##### Arch Linux:
```
sudo pacman -S xclip
```

Remember to use `:checkhealth {plugin}` if you're having a hard time fixing an error in this vim build. Not every single solution and requirement is here so keep that in mind.

Hope you enjoy! This repo is being actively updated according to my needs.
